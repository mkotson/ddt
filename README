Description
-----------

Disk Drive Test (ddt) is a utility for testing storage interfaces and 
disk drives. It was originally written to test eSATA interfaces for
motherboard designs, but has been proven useful in all areas of
storage testing. 

Disk Drive Test will launch multiple read and write threads to the 
storage device defined in the command line options. Each thread has its
own buffer filled with random data that is written to the disk and 
then read back and verified. The size of the files written is also
defined in the command line. See the -h option for more information
on specific usage. 

To make sure that data being written to the disk is read back from
disk and not filesystem cache, the total number of bytes written
(threads * minfilesize of each file) should be greater than the amount 
of total system memory.

Disk Drive Test provides real-time status on the test running,
including amount of time left, SMART status, drive temperature, CPU
utilization, and thread status. It also logs test status in the system
event log.

Running as superuser (root) is required for the reading of SMART data.
